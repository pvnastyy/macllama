This will be my run through on a basic App via flutter to create a local chatbot for use without internet, or security concerns.
The fist edition will consist of a basic flutter front end that stores chats and is contextually threaded.
The back end will be hosted locally
All runs are developed and tried on a Macbook Air M3 with 16 GB of RAM. This app will be prioritized for performance on this system configuration.
